# Overview

An app to assist you when your wingman isn’t available. WINGLET will help guide the user to the perfect date after finding their match. After logging on, the user will be prompted to fill out a quiz based on the user and their date’s preferences. Questions asked will revolve around topics such as music taste, hobbies & food preferences. Upon finishing the quiz, the perfect date is complete. The application will generate a Spotify playlist, city locations, and events to attend.
